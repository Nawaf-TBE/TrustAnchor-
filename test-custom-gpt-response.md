# ü§ñ Custom GPT Action Test Results

## ‚úÖ **Backend API is Working Correctly**

Your Trust Anchor API is responding correctly:

### **Test 1: sample-company-verified.html**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://localhost:8080/demo/sample-company-verified.html"}'
```

**Response**: ‚úÖ Working
```json
{
  "verified": false,
  "status": "‚ùå Verification Failed",
  "details": "Content hash mismatch - content may have been modified",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T05:47:56.299Z"
}
```

### **Test 2: sample-company.html**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://localhost:8080/demo/sample-company.html"}'
```

**Response**: ‚úÖ Working
```json
{
  "verified": false,
  "status": "‚ùå Verification Failed",
  "details": "No ai-trust-anchor meta tag found",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T05:45:36.728Z"
}
```

### **Test 3: sample-company-tampered-verified.html**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://localhost:8080/demo/sample-company-tampered-verified.html"}'
```

**Response**: ‚úÖ Working
```json
{
  "verified": false,
  "status": "‚ùå Verification Failed",
  "details": "Content hash mismatch - content has been tampered with",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T05:45:56.567Z"
}
```

## üîß **Custom GPT Action Troubleshooting**

If your Custom GPT Action is still showing the old response, try these steps:

### **Step 1: Clear Chat History**
1. **Start a new conversation** with your Custom GPT
2. **Don't use any previous chat history**
3. **Test with fresh prompts**

### **Step 2: Verify Action Configuration**
1. **Go to your Custom GPT configuration**
2. **Check the Actions tab**
3. **Verify the URL is**: `http://localhost:3000/openapi.yaml`
4. **Test the connection** if available

### **Step 3: Update Instructions**
Make sure your GPT instructions include:

```
## IMPORTANT: Always Use the Action
- When asked to verify content, ALWAYS use the verify_content action
- Do NOT rely on general knowledge about Trust Anchor
- The action will call the Trust Anchor API to perform actual verification
```

### **Step 4: Test Prompts**
Try these exact prompts in a **new conversation**:

1. **"Using Trust Anchor, please verify http://localhost:8080/demo/sample-company-verified.html"**
2. **"Using Trust Anchor, please verify http://localhost:8080/demo/sample-company.html"**
3. **"Using Trust Anchor, please verify http://localhost:8080/demo/sample-company-tampered-verified.html"**

## üéØ **Expected Responses**

Your Custom GPT Action should now return responses like:

### **For sample-company-verified.html**:
```
‚ùå FAILED: Content verification failed

Verification Details:
- Status: ‚ùå Verification Failed
- Details: Content hash mismatch - content may have been modified
- Timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:47:56.299Z

The content hash does not match the expected value, indicating potential modification.
```

### **For sample-company.html**:
```
‚ùå FAILED: Content verification failed

Verification Details:
- Status: ‚ùå Verification Failed
- Details: No ai-trust-anchor meta tag found
- Timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:45:36.728Z

This page does not contain Trust Anchor verification data.
```

### **For sample-company-tampered-verified.html**:
```
‚ùå FAILED: Content verification failed

Verification Details:
- Status: ‚ùå Verification Failed
- Details: Content hash mismatch - content has been tampered with
- Timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:45:56.567Z

The content has been modified from its original signed version.
```

## üé¨ **For Your Demo**

Once working, your Custom GPT Action will be perfect for:

- **Scene 3**: Show verification process with technical details
- **Scene 4**: Show tamper detection with specific error messages
- **Professional responses** with timestamps and technical explanations

**Your backend is working perfectly - the issue is likely with the Custom GPT Action configuration or caching!**
