## üé¨ **Scene 1: The Problem (0:00-0:15)**

### **Setup**
**URL**: ChatGPT interface (as shown in screenshot)

### **Narrator Script**

**Opening (0:00-0:03)**
*"Today, I want to show you a critical problem facing AI and the web: misinformation and content tampering. Let me demonstrate with a real example using ChatGPT."*

**Action**: Show ChatGPT interface

---

**Show the Question (0:03-0:06)**

**Narrator**: *"I'm asking ChatGPT about the battery life of the TechCorp Z-1 laptop. This is a simple, straightforward question that should have a clear answer."*

**Action**: 
- Point to the user's question: *"What is the battery life of the TechCorp Z-1 laptop?"*
- Highlight that this is a legitimate question about product specifications

---

**Show the Problem Response (0:06-0:12)**

**Narrator**: *"Look at ChatGPT's response: 'The TechCorp Z-1 laptop has a 48-hour battery life.' This is completely wrong! The actual battery life is 22 hours, not 48 hours."*

**Action**: 
- Point to the AI's response: *"The TechCorp Z-1 laptop has a 48-hour battery life."*
- Emphasize the dramatic difference: 22 hours vs 48 hours

**Narrator**: *"This is a 118% increase from the actual specification. Imagine if a customer made a purchasing decision based on this false information. They would be severely disappointed when their laptop only lasts 22 hours instead of the promised 48 hours."*

**Explain the Problem (0:12-0:15)**

**Narrator**: *"This is the problem: AI systems like ChatGPT are trained on web content, but if that content gets tampered with or contains false information, the AI will learn and repeat those falsehoods. Without cryptographic verification, there's no way to ensure the content AI learns from is authentic."*

**Action**: 
- Point to the response
- Emphasize the impact on AI training and user trust

---

## üéØ **Key Points to Emphasize:**

### **The Problem:**
1. **False Information**: AI gives 48 hours instead of 22 hours
2. **No Verification**: No way to know if source content is authentic
3. **AI Training Impact**: AI learns from potentially tampered content
4. **User Trust**: Users make decisions based on false information

### **The Impact:**
- **Customer Disappointment**: Expecting 48 hours, getting 22 hours
- **False Advertising**: AI becomes a vector for misinformation
- **Trust Erosion**: Users can't trust AI responses about products
- **Business Impact**: Companies lose credibility when AI spreads false specs

## üöÄ **Transition to Scene 2:**

**Narrator**: *"So how can we solve this? How can we ensure that AI systems learn from authentic, verified content? That's where Trust Anchor comes in. Let me show you how we can cryptographically verify content before AI systems learn from it."*

**Action**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/frontend/index.html`
